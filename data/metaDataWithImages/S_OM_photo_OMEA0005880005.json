            "textAttributionSnippet": "(en) A year 1918 postpass postcard with motif of Lk\u00f6pping fire station. Addressed to Vikingstad fertile Gunhild Axbom.\nAt the time of the picture, the fire station was relatively recently erected. It was drawn in the national romantic style by the master builder Nils Meijer with the help of architect Nils Rosell. The prominent Axel Brunskog, in Lk\u00f6pping, also submitted architectural proposals but was overcome. As inspiration for Meijer and Rosell, the fire station stood in Wilmersdorff, Berlin. It fulfilled well the view of the fire brigade. The fire soldiers must move out of a stronghold that gives the impression of their dangerous and aggressive profession.\nThe building was placed on one for measuring the height of the line purchase. This led to a downhill trip to the town. Two automobiles, one stepping truck and one for manhood and gear were purchased at the time of the move. However, despite the fact that the horses were sold off, some horse-tensioned equipment was still allowed to be moved as a guarantor for the new brave automobiles.
