From 1847 in service as a regimental physician at the First Life-Grenadar Regiment in Lk\u00f6pping but not permanent residence in the city until 1867. Parallel to the medical profession, he was a recognised author of novels and short stories.  At the beginning of the 1860s, he lost the desire to write that kind of literature.
