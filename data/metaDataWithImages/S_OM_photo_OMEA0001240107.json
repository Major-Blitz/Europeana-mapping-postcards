The family owned a farm with a workshop at NyFamiljen 34. In addition to the family, the estate was inhabited by ges\u00e4ller, larch lung and teacher boys. The movement appears to be significant, but was settled after the death of Master Torling in 1812. After his mother died in 1825, Charlotte remained with her two-year-old sister Hedvig Eva. Both were unmarried and would remain alive. Charlotte died on the farm in the last days of December 1881.
